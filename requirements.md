## My Schedule Clock Requirements 

### The Problem I'm Solving
I'm an intense, all-or-nothing person who either hyperfocuses until I'm fried (forgetting to blink, drink water, or move) OR I'm a phone-scrolling vegetable between meetings. There's no middle ground. Without a timer running, time just... disappears into piano playing or watching tiktoks. I need that constant time pressure to stay productive, but also boundaries to prevent the crash-and-burn cycle.

### What This Clock Actually Does
- **Runs automatically all day** - No buttons, no decisions. It just tells me "hey, it's 10:30, you should be in Work Block 2" 
- **Shows my day visually** - I can literally see how much day I've burned through before deciding to doom-scroll
- **Follows MY strict schedule** - 34 pomodoros from 6am to midnight, with my specific routine blocks (morning shower, dinner, prep tomorrow)
- **Real-time countdown** - Always shows what I'm doing NOW and how many minutes until the next thing
- **Progress tracking** - "You've done 12/34 pomodoros today" gives me that perspective I lose

### Why It Works For Me
Instead of fighting my extreme personality, it works WITH it. The clock gives me permission to be intense during focus blocks (because there's a built-in end) and removes the guilt during breaks (because they're scheduled). It's like having training wheels for time management.

### Future Features I Want
- **Success tracking** - Check off each block as actually completed vs just... existed through
- **Task planning view** - Drag tasks into specific pomodoros (recurring ones like "brush teeth" saved as templates)
- **Backlog management** - See what's been sitting there too long
- **Calendar history** - Look back at my actual completion patterns

### The Vibe
It's not about being a productivity robot - it's about having a cute mushroom friend who keeps me company and gently reminds me where I am in my day. Like Animal Crossing but for time management. The strictness is wrapped in pixel art cuteness so it doesn't feel oppressive.

Basically, I want to build myself a time prosthetic because my natural time sense is broken from all the dopamine hijacking, and that's totally fine. The clock is my external executive function. üçÑ
